## Purpose

To produce standardized figures for the FLUXNET data

See current report here: [https://viz.datascience.arizona.edu/fluxnet-figures/](https://viz.datascience.arizona.edu/fluxnet-figures/)

Code from the Quarto report is extracted as a separate R script by running `knitr::purl("plot_fluxnet.qmd", documentation = 2)`.
